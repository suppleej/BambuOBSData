# Bambu Lab 3D Printer Data Collector
### Made with OBS-Studio in mind for streaming
Forked from camarokris to resolve the issues with how Bambu sends data since they created it - follow the instructions there to get everything set up, but use this repo. There are only a few settings that I am pulling data for since Bambu Labs changed how data was being sent, look at the assets folder when running to grab the files for OBS. Currently just Nozzle Temp in celcius, layer number, percent complete and time remaining.
